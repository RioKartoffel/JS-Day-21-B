# JS-Day-21-B
Content Placeholder

These codes create a simple HTML page with a card layout containing a header image, a title, an excerpt, and an author section. The card layout is styled using CSS, and the data displayed in the card is generated using JavaScript.

The JavaScript code fetches the HTML elements from the page and sets their content with the hardcoded data. It also removes the CSS classes that create the background animation effect after a delay of 2500 milliseconds using the setTimeout function.

Overall, the codes demonstrate a simple way to create a content placeholder or loading animation using CSS and JavaScript.
